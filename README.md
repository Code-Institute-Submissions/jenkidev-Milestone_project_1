# Milestone_project_1
Hi! My name is Morgan Jenkins and this will be the first Milestone project for my Code institute course.

## Project Description
This website will be a fitness website that will include a landing page, 5 exercise pages based on different muscle groups and a form page for applying for personalised workout plan. It will inform the user about the benefits of exercise, inform them about muscle groups and provide a resource for a number of exercises.

## Project Development and Planning
I planned this project with a focus on User goals and UX, including the 5 planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface. I wanted to make sure the website was easily accessible and responsive.

### Goals

#### Project inspiration
My inspiration for this project came from my shift from a more active job to an office based job where I work at a computer. I noticed an increase in my weight and a lowering in my mood which was reversed when I began consistent exercise. I would imagined this is a scenario other office workers find themselves in and so I wanted to create a website for them.

#### Purpose of the project
To create a simple to use and accessible website with a list of easy to perform exercises and outlining the benefits of them. 
#### User Goals
1. To understand the benefits of exercise on physical and mental wellbeing.
2. Have exercise to a repository of differnt exercises based on muscle group.
3. Access to a contact form for a personalised workout plan.
4. To feel empowered to begin exercising.

It was through these user goals that I defined the scope and purpose of this website.

## Design and Structure

### Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to create the basic structure for the website. After looking at other fitness websites I decided to keep the basic structure for the desktop and tablet display to be the same. Any changes between these two in the finished project would be as a result of responsiveness as it pertains to UX priciples.

<details><summary>Desktop and tablet wireframe</summary><img src="assets/images/Read-me-images/Wireframe_desktop_and_tablet.png"></details><br>

The mobile site would be different however, I believed a vertically aligned webpage with all the items sequentially would be ideal as this is intended for first time exercisers so it would be important for them to see all the information on the webpage and it would follow the design of more common mobile applications e.g. news feeds.

### Intended Structure

There are three main components that make up this website.

1. The home/landing page: This is where the User will begin read a little about the benefits of exercise and be enticed to read about the exercises.

2. The exercise pages: These will be split over 5 pages related to their muscle groups. That way more experienced users can find something they are looking for straight away and beginners can learn what exercises effect which muscles.

3. Personal Workout page: This will be a form submission page where the user can list their information and submit a request for a personalised workout. (<strong>Just for clarity if you fill out the form you will not get a personalised workout, this is just for the purposes of the project.</strong>)

The only intended path is for the user to begin on the landing page, the intent is for new users to be empowered and inticed to look through all of the information and for experienced users to know what they are looking for and have easy access to it. Both of these users can use the nav bar to acomplish this task.

### Colour and Font Design

After researching other fitness websites there seemed to be a mix of designs between bright whites and lighter colours and dark backgrounds with high contrasts. I decided on the latter colour scheme for my design purely on personal preferences and advice from colleagues who seem to prefer dark mode themes on most of their devices.

For the background I decided on <strong>rgb(50, 50, 50)</strong> as I felt it was a dark enough background without being too dark as to seem oppresive and harsh on the eyes.

For the Nav Bar I did want this to stand out and be very obvious and apparent on the page so I chose a strong red colour, <strong>rgb(255,50,50)</strong> this would allow eyes to quickly locate to the nav bar.

For the Header texts I wanted them to be quite bold and impactful so I chose a bright white-ish colour <strong>rgb(213, 204, 206)</strong>.

For the footer I wanted a contrasting colour with the background to indicate that it was a seperate section so I decided on a softer red colour so as not to be too harsh and jarring <strong>rgb(180,50,50)</strong>

However for the sections that users would be reading for longer I felt this colour was a bit harsh on the eyes over extended periods so decided to go for a softer white/grey colour,<strong> #fafafa</strong> which still showed good contrast but was easier on the eyes.

Moving onto the fonts I used <strong>Exo</strong> and <strong>Oswald</strong> for the majority of the site as these are softer fonts that would seem more inviting to users newer to exercise and less intimidating.<br>For any calls to action I utilised <strong>Roboto</strong> as it was a more impactful font and I felt would make these parts stand out more. Furthermore I used this font for the personal training form as to me seemed a better font for someone serious about beginning a workout plan.

## Code and Tools

### Languages Used

* HTML
* CSS

### Tools and technologies

* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/): Used to create and preview the code.

* [Github](https://github.com/): Used to store the code in a repository after pushing from gitpod and for version control.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Used as a library and to help with responsiveness and layout design of the site.

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): Used for generating the wireframes to outline the basic design of the project.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Used to provide stylised and appropriate fonts for the site.

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/): Used to provide high quality stock photos for the website.

* [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/): Used to compress previously mentioned images into sizes better suited for a website to help with performance.

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): Provided quality social media icons to improve UX of the site 

## Website Pages and features
### 1. Site wide Features  

#### Logo

This was a image that I created myself in paint using basic tools adorned with the name of the website. I decided that this would also be a link back to the home page as that is a common practice among websites. I decided it would be front and center at the top of both the desktop and mobile pages. Upon adding it to the page as the colour did not match the background the sharp edges looked to harsh so I added a border radius of 50px to all corners after research showed most logos on the market moving in a more rounded direction after updates.

## Bug Fixes

* Issue arose where a horizontal scroll bar was being included even when everything seemed contained in the correct margins and padding. Issue resolved by including "no-gutters" class to the div that contained rows as this is an automatic addition of the bootstrap framework.

## Credits
