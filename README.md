## Project Development and Planning


## Page list
### 1. Landing Page 
This page will talk about the benefits of exercise inclusding mental and physical side, and how it is very important for software engineers to dedicate time to it as their job is very sedentary. There will be an emphasis on light exercise on this page something just to get people moving and a call to action if those reading want to take a more serious approach to exercise.

### 2. Arms
This page will have an emphasis on arm exercises. These will be your dumbell bicep curl, tricep dips and hammer curl. It will be stressed on this page how these muscles are often considered for aesthetic purposes however it is important when exercising for a well rounded approach as a lot of compound movements use these muscles in a smaller way and neglect can lead to injury.
### 3. Shoulders
This page will have an emphasis on shoulder exercises. These will be dumbell shoulder press, lateral delt raise. 
### 4. Back
Lat pull down, weighted rows, bent over rows
### 5. Core
Russian twists, Situps, Plank
### 6. Legs
Squats, Stair Climbs, Lunges

Each of the above pages will have a brief description of the benefits of working out this muscle group followed by a list of exercises that will work out that group. Each exercise will include a picture of the exercise in question (gif if available) thus along with a description of how to carry out that exercise.

### Workout Schedule

This page will contain a table that will allow a user to enter their workout plan. This Can then be exported to a seperate page that can be downloaded or printed off.

##Bug Fixes

* Issue arose where a horizontal scroll bar was being included even when everything seemed contained in the correct margins and padding. Issue resolved by including "no-gutters" class to the div that contained rows as this is an automatic addition of the bootstrap framework.
